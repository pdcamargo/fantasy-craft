If you choose a surface, the seal can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this jutsu, the seal is broken and this jutsu ends without being triggered. The seal is nearly invisible, requiring an Investigation or Ninshou check vs your ninjutsu save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the seal when you cast the jutsu. For seals inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the seal, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. You can further refine the trigger so the jutsu is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the seal, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the seal, you can store a Ninjutsu or Genjutsu of B-Rank or lower in the seal by casting it as part of creating the seal. The jutsu must target a single creature or an area. The jutsu being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the seal is triggered, the stored jutsu is cast. If the jutsu has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the seal.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature. As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be a genjutsu, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Illusion check against your genjutsu save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature",

Wind: This jutsu gains an additional 30 feet of range and increases the size of its cone by +10ft. Creatures instead take 5d6 slashing and 5d6 wind damage and gain one rank of Bleeding on a failed saving throw. Fire: Creatures instead 14d4+14 fire damage and gain 1 rank of Burned on a failed saving throw. Water: Creatures instead take 10d6 cold damage and gain 1 rank of Chilled, fall prone, and are knocked back 15 feet on a failed saving throw. The affected area becomes a source of water for the next minute for jutsu of B-Rank or lower. Lightning: Creatures instead take 6d12 lightning damage and are Shocked and Weakened for 1d4 rounds on a failed saving throw (roll once, for all affected",
